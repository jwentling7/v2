# Personal Website v2

I took the look of v1 of my site and recreated it using SCSS. I also transfered it to WordPress by creating my own theme from scratch.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- WordPress
- REST API
- React
- GitHub

## Upgrades from v1

- Added a blog with comment section
- Added an Education & Certificate section to the homepage
- Added a live search function to search blog posts
- Created a custom plugin that adds custom blocks so I can change the information on the homepage from the admin side.

## TODO

- Create contact form
